#Notice
It is only a preview.
The code is under heavy development.

最近忙别的东西去了，修复bug，重构项目估计要推迟到十一期间，发出来主要是为了治治拖延症.

## Pull-to-refresh

I folked Android-PullToRefresh(https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh) and add an extention (PullToRefreshRecyclerView) to support RecyclerView.
If you need Pull-to-refresh, you should use this one.

You can get it from https://github.com/dkmeteor/Android-PullToRefresh-RecyclerView-Extention

There is also a copy in Library folder.
